## About
Career is a common interest for many AI-researchers. Unlike other job positions, the most important qualification for researchers is research fit with a company. However, it isn't easy to know what would be the company that will fit with one's research. 

To address this, we analyzed academic papers and their authors, specifically sourcing from [openreview](https://openreview.net), a prominent open-access archive. Our focus is on examining the affiliations of authors who contribute to leading AI conferences(NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR), and discerning patterns between their research work and the institutions they are associated with. This project aims to serve as an effective career guidance tool, for not only the junior researchers but also senior researchers who are looking for their new and next career.

## Data acquisition 
**TODO** : Write about data acquisition and add source code. Write feature in table format.

### Data feature

#### Author feature
|    Type    |   Feature 1   | Feature 2   | Feature 3   |  Feature 4 | Feature 5 |  
|:------:|:---------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------:|:--------:|  
| **Author** | author_id | affiliation|      |          |           |

#### Paper feature
|    Type    |   Feature 1   | Feature 2   | Feature 3   |  Feature 4 | Feature 5 |  
|:------:|:---------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------:|:--------:|  
| **Paper**  | paper_id  |     year       | abstract | keywords |   |  


## Data preprocess
After we obtained author and paper data, we made a single author node data by joining a *paper_id* column.  Also there was a data imbalancing problem in the original dataset. As a target affiliation label, we used 5-top company affiliations(Google, Microsoft, DeepMind, Facebook, and Amazon) and 5-top academy affiliations(MIT, Stanford Univ, Tsinghua Univ, Carnegie Mellon Univ, and Peking Univ), 10 affiliations in total.

</p>

As can be seen in the figure, most of the author affiliation is *Google*, (which is about ??%).  
Therefore, we performed oversampling/undersampling to handle the imbalanced data.

## Environment setting
* NVCC : 11.6
* GPU : RTX 3090
```
conda env create --file environment.yaml
```

## Dataset
We provide our dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kS5mJAHnnpPLVAxf5LwrOYpMn0Wdm8Im?usp=sharing). Please download *dataset* folder and place it in your working directory.

## How to run
For reproducibility, simply change the *seed* into 0,1 and 2 and calculate the average accuracy.
### XGBoost
```

```

### GAT
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python GAT/main.py \
    --dropout 0.4 \
    --feature_dim 1000 \
    --seed 0 \
    --lr 0.005 \
    --dim_h 1024 \
    --heads 8 \
    --model GAT
```

## Performance
This is average accuracy over 3 seeds.
* XGBoost : ??%
* GAT : 55%

### Analysis
Surprisingly, traditional machine learning approach (XGBoost) shows better performance than modern GNN models.  
We analyze the data and found that our data is highly disconnected which hinders message passing between the most of the nodes and prone to overfitting in a few subgraphs.

</p>

Given the highly disconnected nature of our data, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) proved to be less effective. Treating our data as tabular rather than graph-structured appears to be a more accurate representation of its characteristics. In attempts to mitigate this issue, we experimented with strategies like random edge addition and virtual node introduction, but these approaches unfortunately reduced model performance. Moving forward, our focus will be on developing GNNs tailored for highly disconnected graphs. This advancement aims to better capture the inter-node relationships, mirroring human networks, which are crucial in career selection processes.
